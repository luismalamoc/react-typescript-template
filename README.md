## Project Structure

This template follows a technical responsibility organization pattern, where code is organized by technical function rather than by domain:

## Customization

### Styling

This template uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the theme in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

### Adding New Features

To add a new feature:

1. Create appropriate directories in the relevant technical areas (components, pages, types, schemas, etc.)
2. Add components, pages, and other necessary files
3. Update the routes in `src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx` to include your new feature

### Task Management

This template includes a complete task management system with the following features:

- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Filter tasks by status
- Set task priorities
- Set due dates for tasks
- Responsive UI for all device sizes

## Deployment

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will generate a `dist` directory with the production-ready files. The application uses hash routing, making it compatible with static hosting services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
